# DashTune Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 16, 2026

## Overview

DashTune is an open-source Jellyfin music player for Android Automotive OS (AAOS). The application connects to your self-hosted Jellyfin server to stream and download music. This privacy policy describes what data is collected and how it is used.

## Data Collected

### Jellyfin Server Data

DashTune connects directly to your Jellyfin server. All media data, authentication credentials, and library information are exchanged between your device and your Jellyfin server. DashTune does not transmit this data to any third party. Please refer to your Jellyfin server's own privacy practices for how that data is handled.

### Analytics and Crash Reporting

DashTune uses Google Firebase services, specifically:

- **Firebase Analytics** — collects anonymous usage data such as app opens, feature usage, device type, and OS version to help improve the application.
- **Firebase Crashlytics** — collects crash logs and diagnostic data (device model, OS version, stack traces) to help identify and fix bugs.

This data is processed by Google. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details on how Google handles this data.

### Data Stored on Device

- Server connection details (URL, authentication tokens) are stored locally on your device.
- Downloaded music files for offline playback are stored locally on your device.

DashTune does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any server other than your configured Jellyfin server and Google Firebase services as described above.

## Data Sharing

DashTune does not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties, except as described in the Analytics and Crash Reporting section above.

## Data Retention

All locally stored data can be removed by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the application. Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics data is retained according to [Google's data retention policies](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

## Children

DashTune does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
